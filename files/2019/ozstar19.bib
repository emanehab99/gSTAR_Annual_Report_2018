abstract = "Low-latency detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact stellar binary coalescences are crucial to enable prompt follow-up observations to astrophysical transients by conventional telescopes, as demonstrated by the first joint GW and electromagnetic observations on July 17, 2017. Searching over the GW parameter space with the requirement of low-latency presents a computational challenge. This will become more severe considering denser sampling of the source space due to improving GW detector sensitivities. In our previous work, a low-latency matched filtering search method was developed, called Summed Parallel Infinite Impulse Response (SPIIR) filtering, which is suitable for parallelization, and an over 50x speedup of this method was achieved using Fermi-generation GPUs. In this paper, a multi-rate scheme for filtering, which reduces the computation time by a factor of several, is presented. The recent features in NVIDIA GPUs, namely the read-only data cache, warp-shuffle, and cross-warp atomic techniques, were exploited to improve the performance of filtering over previous GPU acceleration by a factor of 1.5∼11x on a Maxwell-generation GPU, whereas on a Pascal-generation GPU, the hardware upgrade can bring along 7∼11x speedup, and a further 1.5∼2.5x speedup can be gained by employing these new techniques. This leads to an over 100x speedup for the multi-rate scheme using the Maxwell GPU, and an over 260x speedup using the Pascal GPU. This GPU-accelerated multi-rate scheme was incorporated into a low-latency search pipeline – the SPIIR pipeline – and an overall near-limit CPU usage reduction is expected. This IIR technique in general and its GPU acceleration technique here hold the potential to find applications in other signal processing fields, such as in image and radio astronomy data processing."

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
	abstract = {We report first results from the CHinese Exoplanet Searching Program from Antarctica (CHESPA)—a wide-field high-resolution photometric survey for transiting exoplanets carried out using telescopes of the AST3 (Antarctic Survey Telescopes times 3) project. There are now three telescopes (AST3-I, AST3-II, and CSTAR-II) operating at Dome A—the highest point on the Antarctic Plateau—in a fully automatic and remote mode to exploit the superb observing conditions of the site, and its long and uninterrupted polar nights. The search for transiting exoplanets is one of the key projects for AST3. During the austral winters of 2016 and 2017 we used the AST3-II telescope to survey a set of target fields near the southern ecliptic pole, falling within the continuous viewing zone of the TESS mission. The first data release of the 2016 data, including images, catalogs, and light curves of 26,578 bright stars (), was presented in Zhang et al. The best precision, as measured by the rms of the light curves at the optimum magnitude of the survey (), is around 2 mmag. We detect 222 objects with plausible transit signals from these data, 116 of which are plausible transiting exoplanet candidates according to their stellar properties as given by the TESS Input Catalog, Gaia DR2, and TESS-HERMES spectroscopy. With the first data release from TESS expected in late 2018, this candidate list will be timely for improving the rejection of potential false-positives.}

In the first stage, aerodynamic forces, frequency spectrum and amplitude of oscillation have been measured as a function of p for rigid cylinder system. The results showed that in the rigid two-cylinder system, there are four distinct regimes. In the second stage, a similar study with varying pitch but also with varying reduced velocity, {\$}{\$}U^*{\$}{\$}, has been conducted for elastically mounted cylinders. It is found that for systems with very small p, the behaviour is highly nonlinear and the oscillation of both bodies exceeds that of a single isolated cylinder. Over a critical value of p the oscillation of the front cylinder is very similar to a single cylinder system and is therefore essentially independent of pitch. However, the rear cylinder behaviour is strongly dependent on the pitch. The rear cylinder can oscillate with an amplitude which is higher or lower than the amplitude of oscillation for a single cylinder depending on the {\$}{\$}U^*{\$}{\$}value.",

A suitableJacono, David Lo structure is a plate or foil that can oscillate across the flow in heave, as well as rotate about an axis perpendicular to the flow in pitch. Here, we model the foil as an ellipse of aspect ratioSheridan, John 6, and the Reynolds number is fixed at 200. We consider the efficacy of this system to extract energy from a flowing fluid. Both the pitching and heaving motion are free so the motion is fully passive, but energy is only extracted from the heaving degree of freedom. We present results showing that the energy extracted is of similar magnitude to the net power of semi-active set-ups when the cost of the activation is accounted for. We also show that at this relatively low Reynolds number, the flow undergoes a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the oscillating foil generates a mean lift force while still extracting energy. The optimal case for energy extraction is also compared to that from Veilleux and Dumas (J. Fluids Struct. 70:102--130, 2017) at a much higher Reynolds number and using a NACA0015 aerofoil. Interestingly it is found that the optimal heave parameters are reasonably similar, indicating that Reynolds number and the details of the body shape only play a minor role in the energy harvesting dynamics.",

abstract = "This study reports on an experimental investigation of the effect of mass ratio on the transverse flow-induced vibration (FIV) response of an elastically mounted square cylinder placed at three different incidence angles: two symmetric with respect to the centreplane, α=0° and 45°; and one asymmetric at 20°. These three angles display different dominant FIV phenomena: transverse galloping and combined vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and galloping for α=0°, VIV for α=45°, and higher branch subharmonic (period-doubled) VIV for α=20° (Nemes et al., 2012). The mass ratio is defined as the ratio of the total oscillating mass (m) to the displaced fluid mass (md), m∗=m∕md. The present results show that the mass ratio (m∗=2.64 – 15.00) has a significant influence on the structural vibration response for all FIV phenomena, and can dictate whether two of these modes exist at all. Three primary observations are presented: for the α=0° case, the combined VIV–galloping response is diminished as the mass ratio is increased, and it ceases to exist for m∗⩾11.31; for the α=45° case, the peak values of the normalised oscillation amplitude during VIV are only reduced marginally with increasing m∗, however the body oscillation amplitude in the desynchronised regions is significantly attenuated; for the α=20° case, there exists a critical mass ratio (mcrit∗≃3.50) above which the higher branch subharmonic VIV does not persist."

abstract = "A series of analytic models are presented of a partially-submerged, straight circular cross-section pipe subjected to reciprocating flow, incorporating viscous and turbulent boundary-layer dissipation. This pipe is the most elementary paradigm for a fixed-type Oscillating Water Column (OWC), and its analysis more generally addresses one aspect of reciprocating pipe flow. The derivation of the dissipation terms in the momentum conservation equations from their origin in the Navier–Stokes equation are explicitly identified. The contribution of different damping sources to the overall energy loss is compared. The flow inside the pipe is assumed fully developed along the entire length, neglecting the effect of the flow development region. For relevance to engineering applications, a power take-off system is modelled assuming that the air compresses and expands isentropically in an air chamber at the top of the pipe. Existing theory is adapted into the current models for computing the hydrodynamic coefficients related to the scattered wave and radiation wave. A novel contribution of this paper is the inclusion of damping due to the wall shear stress, modelled for the reciprocating flow system inside the pipe. Comparison between the damping factors in relatively short OWCs confirms the findings in the literature that the major part of the damping is due to the radiation wave. However, it is found that with the increase of the draft length, the wall shear stress damping may also become an important factor in the resulting dynamics."

abstract = "This paper presents a study of the flow-induced vibration of an elliptical cross section at various angles of attack immersed in a free stream. The body is elastically-mounted and constrained to move only in the cross-stream direction. Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are used to study the system response as a function of the spring stiffness and the angle of attack. The elliptical cross section used has an aspect ratio Γ=1.5. This aspect ratio is large enough so that the deformation from a circular cylinder is obvious, but not so large that the geometry is not related to the cylinder. Because of this, the impact of the symmetry of the system on the flow-induced vibration is studied without also introducing other complexities such as sharp corners or fixed separation points. The body is light with a mass ratio (body mass to displaced fluid mass) of one. The results show a surprisingly wide range of different flow regimes. For small angles (where the body is slightly streamlined) the flow behaviour is similar to that of a cylinder. However, for large angles, where the body is far from symmetric with respect to the wake centreline, the flow can be markedly different with distinct asymmetric modes, including one which is period-doubled. For angles where the body regains its symmetry (aligned across the flow and slightly bluff), an asymmetric mode continues to exist, apparently the result of a spontaneous symmetry breaking that is dependent on Reynolds number. Large-amplitude oscillations persist for very low stiffness or high reduced velocity, and this is explained in terms of the dependence of a critical mass on the angle of attack."

	abstract = {We have built Prism, a Probabilistic Regression Instrument for Simulating Models. Prism uses the Bayes linear approach and history matching to construct an approximation (“emulator”) of any given model by combining limited model evaluations with advanced regression techniques, covariances, and probability calculations. It is designed to easily facilitate and enhance existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by restricting plausible regions and exploring parameter space efficiently. However, Prism can additionally be used as a stand-alone alternative to MCMC for model analysis, providing insight into the behavior of complex scientific models. With Prism, the time spent on evaluating a model is minimized, providing developers with an advanced model analysis for a fraction of the time required by more traditional methods. This paper provides an overview of the different techniques and algorithms that are used within Prism. We demonstrate the advantage of using the Bayes linear approach over a full Bayesian analysis when analyzing complex models. Our results show how much information can be captured by Prism and how one can combine it with MCMC methods to significantly speed up calibration processes (>15 times faster).

    abstract = { Learning to read is foundational for literacy development, yet many children in primary school fail to become efficient readers despite normal intelligence and schooling. This condition, referred to as developmental dyslexia, has been hypothesized to occur because of deficits in vision, attention, auditory and temporal processes, and phonology and language. Here, we used a developmentally plausible computational model of reading acquisition to investigate how the core deficits of dyslexia determined individual learning outcomes for 622 children (388 with dyslexia). We found that individual learning trajectories could be simulated on the basis of three component skills related to orthography, phonology, and vocabulary. In contrast, single-deficit models captured the means but not the distribution of reading scores, and a model with noise added to all representations could not even capture the means. These results show that heterogeneity and individual differences in dyslexia profiles can be simulated only with a personalized computational model that allows for multiple deficits. }

abstract = "Radiation is energy travelling through space. Sunlight radiation such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation are higher-energy radiation which are used in medicine and energy industry such as dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We recently designed new Ru-complexes through novel ligands based on a recently synthesised high performance dye, i.e. [(η6-p-cymene)Ru(4,4′,5,5′-H4tcbpy)Cl]Cl [1] (A as L1-Ru-L2) for applications in DSSCs. Two electron rich top-ligands, η6-N, N, N′, N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (new dye D) and η6- 1,4 di[(dimethylamino)ethyl] benzene (new dye E) outperform other ligands for the new high performance Ru-complexes. Our time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G+(d)/LANL2DZ functional and basis-set model reveals the apparent enhancement of the major UV–vis bands of metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in the new dyes. The major UV–vis bands of the new dyes D and E are red shifted 35 nm and 78 nm, respectively, from the MLCT band of the reference dye A centred at 433 nm. We further discovered that the electron rich top-ligands (L1) are responsible to lift a cluster of occupied outer valence orbitals such as HOMO, HOMO-1 and HOMO-2 in the new D and E complexes, while the virtual orbitals which concentrate on the lower ligand L2 (4,4′,5,5′ H4 tcbpy) remain almost unchanged. The top-ligand L1 enhances the MLCT transition of the new dyes D and E through the dominant 7dz2 electrons of the transition metal Ru in their HOMOs. The present study provides the rational of ligand control for metal complexes in broader applications such as electron transfer and electronics."

abstract  ="The fragmentation of glycine (NH2CH2COOH) has been studied by photoelectron–photoion coincidence{,} PEPICO{,} experiments at 60 eV photon energy. Glycine practically fragments at the ionization threshold{,} with the charge being on the H2NCH2+ moiety{,} due to ejection of an electron from the nitrogen lone pair of the highest occupied molecular orbital. To observe the formation of the complementary cation COOH+ further energy is needed. The flexibility with respect to rotation about the C–C{,} C–N and C–O bonds makes glycine exist in the gas phase in several conformers of both Cs and C1 point group symmetry in the neutral as well as ion states. The ionization can lead to stabilization of some conformations{,} rearrangements and{,} last but not least{,} H migration between the two moieties. The results of these experiments prove the sensitivity of PEPICO to pin point all these processes."}
