The software has been selected by the LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaborations as the code that will perform all astrophysical inference of gravitational-wave events.  At the time of writing, we are in the middle of an extensive LIGO/Virgo internal code review process; at the conclusion of this (hopefully in the coming month), all new gravitational-wave events will be analysed using Bilby.\r\n\r\nThis software, and the OzStar project, have been used in a number of subsequent papers:\r\n* Hernandez Vivanco, Smith, Thrane, & Lasky (2019) \u201cAccelerated detection of the binary neutron star gravitational-wave background\u201d arXiv:1903.05778 (under review)\r\n* Talbot, Smith, Thrane, & Poole (2019) \u201cParallelized inference for gravitational-wave astronomy\u201d arXiv:1904.02863 (under review)\r\n* Payne, Talbot, & Thrane (2019) \u201cHigher order gravitational-wave modes with likelihood reweighting\u201d arXiv:1905.05477 (under review)\r\n* Powell & M\u00fcller (2019) \u201cGravitational wave emission from 3D explosion models of core-collapse supernovae with low and normal explosion energies\u201d MNRAS 487, 1178\r\n* Ashton, Lasky, Graber & Palfreyman (2019) \u201cRotational evolution of the Vela pulsar during the 2016 glitch\u201d Nature Astronomy (accepted; arXiv:1907.01124)\r\n* Easter, Lasky, Casey, Rezzolla, & Takami (2019) \u201cComputing fast and reliable gravitational waveforms of binary neutron star merger remnants\u201d arXiv:1811.11183 (under review)\r\n* Sarin, Lasky, & Ashton (2019) \u201cX-ray afterglows of short gamma-ray bursts: magnetar or fireball\u201d ApJ 872, 114\r\n* Sarin, Lasky, Sammut, & Ashton (2018) \u201cX-ray guided gravitational-wave search for binary neutron star merger remnants\u201d PRD 98, 043011\r\n\r\nImportant results in gravitational-wave astronomy from the above list includes significant speed-ups of gravitational-wave inference using GPUs and also new algorithms for detecting the stochastic gravitational-wave background.  Outside of direct gravitational-wave parameter estimation, the Bilby code is also being used to study and understand multiple astrophysical phenomena, including short gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, and pulsar glitches.  In the last of those categories, we recently had a paper accepted to Nature Astronomy, that provides the best limit on a glitch rise time and identifies two new features of glitches that had not previously been identified.  \r\n\r\nBilby was highlighted as one of three primary science cases for the $2.8M NCRIS-funded Gravitational-Wave Data Centre.  It has further been used as the primary basis of a ~$1.2M LIEF bid that is currently under review, led by Monash CIs Thrane and Lasky, along with Swinburne (Hurley & Bailes).  Finally, the Bilby project has been awarded two ADACS Software Support Grants worth a total of ~19 FTE weeks.  \r\n\r\n* The original code name way Peyote, which explains the project name."

                    "We have used a self-consistent, semi-numerical model of galaxy evolution and reionization (RSAGE, Seiler et al. 2019) to study the Epoch of Reionization. We have investigated (1) how the ionization topology, i.e. the evolution of the sizes and distribution of the ionized regions, changes as the properties of the underlying high-redshift galaxies are varied and (2) how 21cm signal observations with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) could distinguish between different scenarios. In particular, we considered three different reionization scenarios that differ in their trends of the ionizing escape fraction (escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies into the intergalactic medium (IGM)) and cover the physically plausible range, i.e. the escape fraction effectively decreasing, being constant, or increasing with halo mass.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we have found that plotting the large-scale versus the small-scale 21cm power provides a strong indicator for the halo or stellar mass dependency of the escape fraction. Our calculations predict that 800h observations with SKA1-LOW will be sufficient to constrain the global trend of the escape fraction with halo mass (Seiler et al. 2019, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.tmp.1578S/abstract).\r\n\r\nSecondly, computing the bispectra of the 21cm signal for our three different reionization scenarios, we have found the 21cm bispectra to be sensitive to the resulting ionization topologies that significantly differ in their size distribution of ionized and neutral regions throughout reionization. From squeezed to stretched triangles, the 21cm bispectra features a change of sign from negative to positive values. The position of the change of sign provides a tracer of the size distribution of the ionized and neutral regions, and allows us to identify three major regimes that the 21cm bispectrum undergoes during reionization. In particular the regime during the early stages of reionization, where the 21cm bispectrum tracks the peak of the size distribution of the ionized regions, provides exciting prospects for pinning down reionization with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (Hutter et al. 2019 (submitted), https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04342)."

In addition to that, we have discovered sources of systematic errors in model selection and investigated implications of spin noise at times to detection of the nHz stochastic gravitational-wave background.

Should this have been caught at the proposal time? 2) I struggled to use my allocated time despite running pretty much full time on the 32 cores of the regular nodes. I overestimated the time in part because I had thought I would be running on twice as many cores."

Physiological interpretation of features in EEG signals has often involved use of collective models of neural populations. These neural population models have dozens of input parameters to describe the properties of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Being able to estimate these parameters by direct fits to EEG data holds the promise of providing a real-time non-invasive method of inferring neuronal properties in different individuals. However, it has long been impossible to fit these nonlinear, multi-parameter models effectively. Here we describe fits of a 22-parameter neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 different subjects, all exhibiting alpha-oscillations. We show how only one parameter, that describing inhibitory dynamics, is constrained by the data, although all parameters are correlated. These results indicate that inhibitory synaptic activity plays a central role in the generation and modulation of the alpha-rhythm in humans.},     number = {5},     doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006694} }"

                    "Indications from Gaia data release 2 are that the tip of the red giant branch (a population II standard candle related to the helium flash in low mass stars) is close to -4 in absolute I magnitude in the Cousins photometric system. Our sample was high-latitude southern stars from the thick disk and inner halo, and our result was consistent with longstanding findings from globular clusters, whose distances were calibrated with RR Lyrae stars. As the Gaia mission proceeds, there is every reason to think an accurate Galactic geometric calibration of tip of the red giant branch will be a significant outcome for the extragalactic distance scale.\r\n\r\nDurre & Mould explored the gas morphology and excitation mechanisms of the ionization cones of the type II Seyfert galaxy NGC 5728. Kinematics derived from near-infrared and optical data from the SINFONI and MUSE Integral Field Units on the VLT reveal active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven outflows powered by a supermassive black hole of mass 3.4 \u00d7 10^7 M \u2609, bolometric luminosity of 1.46 \u00d7 10^44 erg s^-1, Eddington ratio of 3.3 \u00d7 10^-2, and an accretion rate of 2.7 \u00d7 10^-2 M \u2609 yr^-1. The symmetric bicone outflows show rapid acceleration to \u00b1250 km s^-1 at \u0303250 pc, decelerating to \u0303130 km s^-1 at 500 pc from the AGN, with an estimated mass outflow rate of 38 M \u2609 yr^-1 the mass ratio of outflows to accretion is 1415. The kinetic power is \u03031.5 \u00d7 10^42 erg s^-1, 1% of the bolometric luminosity. Over the AGN active lifetime of \u030310^7 yr, 1.6 \u00d7 10^8 M \u2609 of gas can become gravitationally unbound from the galaxy, a large proportion of the gas mass available for star formation in the nuclear region. The outflow axis is nearly parallel to the plane of the galaxy. This geometry supports the unified model of AGNs, as these angles preclude seeing the accretion disk, which is obscured by the dusty torus."

                    "We have used resources on the Swinburne OzSTAR supercomputer for our project: \"Determining the kinematic structure of jets in post-asymptotic giant branch binary stars\". During the past two periods (ASTAC 2018-B and 2019-A) we have been rewarded a total of 294.4kSUs (102.4kSUs + 192kSUs). For the first part of this project, we have written a model-fitting code with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine, in order to determine the spatio-kinematic structure of these jets. This is done by creating synthetic spectra of the system from a geometrical model, which is then fitted to our obtained high-resolution optical spectra using the MCMC-routine. \r\nThanks to the allocated time on the Swinburne OzSTAR supercomputer, we have successfully tested this generic code. We also successfully determined the structure of IRAS19135+3937, a post-AGB binary system with a jet. From these results, we can further investigate the accretion and jet launching physics of this system.\r\n\r\nWe have finished this first part of the project and have submitted a paper to the Astronomy & Astrophysics Journal (Bollen et al. 2019, submitted).\r\n\r\nFor our current project (part II), we are using this application to study the jet-diversity in our whole sample of jetting post-AGB binaries. This jet-diversity will offer us further possibilities to understand jet properties. By studying the diverse jet properties of the rich sample of post-AGB binaries as a function of orbital parameters, we can provide further insight into the origin of the accreted gas: circumbinary disk or post-AGB star."

                    "Solar flares are hugely energetic phenomena occurring regularly in the solar atmosphere.  Flares begin with a reconnection event in solar corona, generating accelerated charged particles interacting with the surrounding plasma medium.  This causes a downward propagation of energy through various mechanisms such as accelerated particles, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, radiation and thermal conduction.  When a flare is sufficiently strong, this energy can travel through the chromosphere and impact with the photosphere.  This causes acoustic pulses to travel through the internal layers of the Sun, known as a sunquake.  By simulating sunquakes we look to improve our knowledge on the type of impacts likely to cause the quakes and gain information relating to the subsurface structure of strongly magnetic regions (local helioseismology) where quakes occur.  OzStar has allowed 3D MHD simulations producing a catalogue of various impacts and resulting sunquakes.  A paper is in preparation which quantifies the effect of varying both the impacting source and the surrounding magnetic field."

                    "- We have completed a joint analysis of galaxy redshift and peculiar velocity datasets from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (led by Caitlin Adams as part of her PhD completed this year).  Our analysis self-consistently measures the growth rate of cosmic structure using information from both the amplitude of galaxy velocities and redshift-space distortions in the galaxy clustering pattern, showing that these determinations are consistent and strengthening the measurement of the local growth rate.\r\n\r\n- We have studied the statistics of the baryon acoustic peak in the galaxy clustering pattern in a range of recent galaxy surveys (led by postdoc Rossana Ruggeri).  We have focussed in particular on the accuracy of the error estimation, and how this is affected by sample variance and should be best determined.\r\n\r\n- We have led combined cosmological analyses of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering as members of the Kilo-Degree imaging Survey (KiDS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaborations (led by faculty Chris Blake).  Our work involved statistical measurements related to lensing and clustering, the creation of realistic galaxy mock catalogues, and the study of techniques to infer the source redshift distributions of the lensing surveys."

These mocks have formed the basis of a series of cosmological analyses preparing for the Taipan survey, including measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift-space distortions, density-field reconstruction, void catalogues and joint density/velocity analyses.

The original WMD3 is very busy, accepting thousands of requests from international researchers daily. Consequently, it will take weeks to months before one can receive the results. Using the local version, the identification and design of microRNAs can be done in just a few hours. Four minor research students were able to utilise the biocomputing pipeline in designing artificial microRNAs to silence the expression of key candidate genes in rice. Four more students will access the said biocomputing pipeline this coming sem. Some of these students will continue to pursue PhD research on functional genomic validation of key genes involved in rice grain quality and nutrition. \""

                    "Octahedral and decahedral anatase particles were modified with nanoparticles of noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu). For the first time, noble-metal-modified particles have been comparatively analyzed to recognize how the different types of faceted anatase morphology can influence photocatalytic activity of samples modified by noble metals in different reaction systems. Selective deposition of gold/silver nanoparticles should result in significant improvement of photocatalytic activity under visible irradiation, and thus high overall activity under solar radiation enabling its commercial applications.\r\n\r\nThermo-optical properties of the nanodisc and metal hole array plasmonic perfect absorber metasurfaces were designed and characterized at mid-infrared wavelengths. Both, radiation emitter and detector systems operating in various spectral domains are highly sought after for a diverse range of applications, one example being future sensor networks employed in the internet-of-things. The highest efficiency of radiation-to-heat and heat-to-radiation conversion was obtained for Au-Si-Au composite structures.\r\n"

DWF coordinated 17 telescopes from radio through gamma-ray and cosmic ray/neutrino for simultaneous, fast-cadneced observations of the same fields at the same time.  Real-time data processing performed on all data, including CTIO Dark Energy Camera optical data processing on OzSTAR, throughout the night.  This fast data processing, and fast identification and analysis of 175,000 transient candidates, enabled very fast response, and later-time, follow up observations by an additional 15 telescopes worldwide.

                    "Using OzSTAR, we repeatedly performed several large Monte Carlo simulations to verify an algorithm that is used to estimate Faraday rotation along the line of sight to astronomical sources such as pulsars, magnetars, and Fast Radio Bursts.  The simulation included generating millions of pulsed signals over a large range of rotation measures and signal-to-noise ratios, and testing that in each case the algorithm produced both the expected value and an accurate estimate of uncertainty.  Our tests exposed a fundamental error in the mathematical derivation of the algorithm, which we corrected before publication.  The results of this test provided much greater confidence in the Faraday rotation measures derived from our experimental data and reported in Caleb et al.

Each RM was estimated using a brute-force search over trial RMs that spanned the maximum measurable range \\\\$\\\\pm 1.18 \\\\times 10^5 \\\\, \\\\mathrm\\\\{rad \\\\, m^2\\\\}\\\\$ (in steps of 1 \\\\$\\\\mathrm\\\\{rad \\\\, m^2\\\\}\\\\$), followed by an iterative refinement algorithm. The measured RRAT RMs are in the range |RM| 1\u2013950 rad m\u22122 with an average linear polarization fraction of 40\u00a0per\u2009cent. Individual single pulses are observed to be up to 100\u00a0per\u2009cent linearly polarized. The RMs of the RRATs and the corresponding inferred average magnetic fields (parallel to the line of sight and weighted by the free electron density) are observed to be consistent with the Galactic plane pulsar population. Faraday rotation analyses are typically performed on accumulated pulsar data, for which hundreds to thousands of pulses have been integrated, rather than on individual pulses. Therefore, we verified the iterative refinement algorithm by performing Monte Carlo simulations of artificial single pulses over a wide range of S/N and RM. At and above an S/N of 17 in linearly polarized flux, the iterative refinement recovers the simulated RM value 100\u00a0per\u2009cent of the time with a typical mean uncertainty of 5 rad m\u22122. The method described and validated here has also been successfully used to determine reliable RMs of several fast radio bursts (FRBs) discovered at Parkes.}\",\r\n    issn = {0035-8711},\r\n    doi = {10.1093/mnras/stz1352},\r\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz1352},\r\n    eprint = {http://oup.prod.sis.lan/mnras/article-pdf/487/1/1191/28753409/stz1352.pdf},\r\n}"

                    "We calculate spectral functions of Bose polaron in the presence of a synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and discover some interesting properties that does not show up in conventional BEC. This result was posted to arXiv (1902.08333) early this year and is now under review in Physical Review Letters. Using OzSTAR allows us to carry calculations in a large parameter space and generate data for illustrative figures. In the near future, we plan to calculate excitations of Bose-Einstein condensation in the presence of a variety of SOC and external traps.\r\n\r\nWe also collaborate with Dr. Ye Cao, who was a previous post-doc here in Swinburne. We are currently calculating the superconducting properties of Penrose crystals, the energy spectrum of which have self-similarity and cannot be resolved analytically. Therefore, we carry numerical simulations on OzStar. By solving the superconducting critical temperature of singlet and triplet state respectively, we give the boundary of two symmetries, and further classify each symmetry and get four topological states p+ip, d+id, f+if and g+ig. The latter two hardly appear in common materials.\r\n\r\nIn another collaboration with Dr. Jing Zhou, a previous visitor of our group, we study the Higgs mode and its dissipation in a Fermi superfluid system. We also calculate polaron properties in the BCS-BEC crossover."

GERLUMPH data was used to establish and demonstrate that deep learning could be used to enhance quasar light curve analysis, with applications to LSST.

We search the entire population of currently known multiple planet systems that contain at least one Jovian planet and find 28 candidates which could host dynamically stable habitable exo-Earths, of which 16 would be detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT.  A second paper present an alternative approach to rapidly assess the dynamical stability of multiple planet systems discovered with TESS, and determine whether an exoplanet system would be capable of hosting a dynamically stable Earth-mass companion in its habitable zone.   We show that it is possible to scale and translate the stability signature in (a,e) space, and combine several together for multiple planetary systems, in order to conservatively assess the dynamical stability of newly discovered multiple planet systems without the need for exhaustive numerical simulations. \""

The new beam-forming software runs twice faster on OzSTAR (compared to the Galaxy cluster at Pawsey HPC) and almost 10 times faster compared to our standard (single-pixel) beam-forming software. "

                    "This is relatively new project that required substantial in-house (Curtin) development of MWA-specific software for data processing. Aside from some delay (a few months) encountered in the related development, and some glitches in data transport at early stages (from Pawsey to OzSTAR) no major problems were encountered. Thanks to Swinburne HPC support, the most recent bottleneck with I/O has now been resolved and the workflow (of the related search jobs) has been suitably altered to ensure they exploit the SSDs. We are currently testing the new processing pipeline and will soon commence ramping up on the processing. \r\n"
